# Austin ArtFinder 

AAF is your one-stop app for all things art in Austin. Find gallery openings, performances, studio tours, and more, plus profiles of local artists and institutions.

A members-only section allows local artists and creatives to connect and network, with a Craigslist-like marketplace where members can offer services, find jobs, search for studio space, collaborate, and more.

AAF is a React-based app using Node and Axios.
